# KPILoggerEXE
 
You will need to allow both the KPILogger.exe and KPICalc.exe to run on your computer if you have not run them before. 

This program does NOT require a network connection (internet or LAN).
This program does NOT require any code libraries 

This program ONLY runs on Windows (exe)


I have provided a zipped version and an unzipped version in the DL file. 

The loadable files are test files for you to use so you can see the functions of the program. Feel free to use them as your base or create your own.
